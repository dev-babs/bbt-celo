- **Contract Interaction:** Ethers.js v6 via Wagmi adapter
- **Key Components:**
  - `GameBoard` - Interactive 3x3 grid with hover effects
  - `GamesList` - Display all available games
  - `PlayGame` - Individual game interaction page
  - `CreateGame` - Create new game with bet amount

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Connect Wallet:** Connect your Ethereum wallet using Reown AppKit
2. **Create Game:** Set a bet amount and create a new game
3. **Join Game:** Find an open game and join it
4. **Play:** Take turns making moves on the 3x3 board
5. **Win:** Get three in a row to win both players' ETH!

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Ethereum wallet for testing (MetaMask recommended)
- Sepolia testnet ETH for transactions

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd BlOcXTacToe-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Reown AppKit Project ID (Get from https://cloud.reown.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=a9fbadc760baa309220363ec867b732e

# Smart Contract Address (Replace with your deployed contract)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

## 🔗 Contract Integration

The frontend expects the following contract interface:

**Read Functions:**
- `getGame(uint256 gameId)` - Returns game data
- `getGameBoard(uint256 gameId)` - Returns the current board state
- `getAllGames()` - Returns array of all game IDs

**Write Functions:**
- `createGame(uint256 betAmount)` - Create a new game
- `joinGame(uint256 gameId)` - Join an existing game
- `makeMove(uint256 gameId, uint256 position)` - Make a move

**Events:**
- `GameCreated(uint256 indexed gameId, address indexed player1, uint256 betAmount)`
- `GameJoined(uint256 indexed gameId, address indexed player2)`
- `MoveMade(uint256 indexed gameId, address indexed player, uint256 position)`
- `GameFinished(uint256 indexed gameId, address indexed winner)`

The contract ABI is defined in `src/hooks/useGame.ts`. Update it to match your contract's actual ABI.
